# fittslaw-it482
Simple application designed and written by myself, for a group project centered around Fitt's Law in IT484 Human Computer Interaction.

The app is written in C#, utilizing Windows Forms. It consists of a series of 12 tests; the user is instructed to move their mouse to each circle as it appears and click within as soon as possible. The application records X/Y coordinates and times the user. Upon completion of all 12 tests, a CSV file is created in the run directory with all of the data and calculations from the user's 12 trials.
